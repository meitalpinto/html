<p> Our third location was at <a href="https://www.govisitcostarica.com/region/city.asp?cID=123" target="_blank"> Santa Teresa, Costa Rica. </a> We stayed here for nine days. Santa Teresa is a small town in Puntarenas Province, Costa Rica. It is located about 150 kilometres west of the capital city of San José. Like other coastal villages on the Nicoya Peninsula, Santa Teresa started as a remote fishing village, relying on agriculture, cattle ranching and small-scale fishing.

<h2 id="headerstyle2">#4 Location - Arenal, Costa Rica </h2>
<p> Our fourth location was at <a href="https://www.arenal.net/" target="_blank"> Arenal, Costa Rica. </a> We stayed here for three days. Arenal Volcano is an active andesitic stratovolcano in north-western Costa Rica around 90 km northwest of San José, in the province of Alajuela, canton of San Carlos, and district of La Fortuna.

<h2 id="headerstyle2">#5 Location - San Blas, Panama </h2>
<p> Our fifth location was at <a href="https://sanblas-islands.com/" target="_blank"> San Blas, Panama. </a> We stayed in this megical island for five days. The San Blas Islands of Panama is an archipelago comprising approximately 365 islands and cays, of which 49 are inhabited.

	<h2 id="headerstyle2">#6 Location - Playa Venao, Panama </h2>
<p> Our sixth and last location was at <a href="https://wikitravel.org/en/Playa_Venao" target="_blank"> Playa Venao, Panama. </a> We stayed in this megical island for five days. A long, protected beach, Playa Venao – officially Venado but pronounced and spelled as 'Venao' – recently transformed from a wild beach to a 'go-to' destination. Surfers lay the first claim to its waters; waves are consistent and break in both directions. Depressingly, this gorgeous stretch of blackish volcanic sand looks like a construction site as building continues apace. Venao will hopefully look lovely again when the construction's finished.
